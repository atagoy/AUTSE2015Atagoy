*   Export subscribers to Excel with a possibillity to filter by categories

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `subscribe-to-category` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Admin
3. Save your settings 'Settings > Subscribe'.
4. Create a page and add shortcode [stc-subscribe] to display stc form subscription.

= Shortcode Attributes =
'category_in' - Use this attribute if you only want one or several categories to be available for subscription. Value to be entered is the name of the category.
'category_not_in' - Use this attribute if you want to exclude categories to be available for subscription. Value to be entered is the name of the category.

For both attributes you can use a comma sign to separate multiple categories, like [stc-subscribe category_in="news, article"].

= Optionally but recommended =
As Wordpress Cron is depending on that you have visits on your website you should set up a cron job on your server to hit http://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php at a regular interval to make sure that WP Cron is running as expected. In current version of Subscribe to Category the WP Cron is running once every hour, that might be an option that is changeable in future versions. 
Therefore a suggested interval for your server cron could be once every 5 minutes.
