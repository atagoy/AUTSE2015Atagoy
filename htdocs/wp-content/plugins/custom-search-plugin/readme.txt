The author of the Custom Search also recommends the following plugins:

* <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-fields-search/">Custom Fields Search</a> - this simple yet utterly practical plugin provides an option to add custom fields to WP search functionality. As a result, any custom field you have on your site can ultimately be shown in the search results, which will come in handy if you are an active user of this very WP functionality.
* <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/updater/">Updater</a> - This plugin updates WordPress core and the plugins to the recent versions. You can also use the auto mode or manual mode for updating and set email notifications.
There is also a premium version of the plugin <a href="http://bestwebsoft.com/products/updater-pro/?k=7b42404bbc8ad8cb8745f8704cba3c9a">Updater Pro</a> with more useful features available. It can make backup of all your files and database before updating. Also it can forbid some plugins or WordPress Core update.
