= Why CSV 2 POST? = 

CSV 2 POST offers more for free than any other importer. If you donate to this project you will not only encourage further
updates of this project - but you'll be supporting the creation of more WordPress autoblogging and data import plugins. I'm
confident you will be impressed at the hundreds of hours I've put into this plugin for you. If you cannot afford to donate - 
a Facebook like, a review, a short video on YouTube or a Tweet will help just as much. Thank you for your support.

== Installation ==

1. Please try to install CSV 2 POST from WordPress.org by going to Plugins --> Add New and searching "CSV 2 POST". This is safer and quicker than any other methods.
1. If your WordPress installation is on a path that includes "csv2post" it will trigger debugging to activate. This is meant for localhost development and can be disabled.
1. Your CSV file should be uploaded using FTP or WordPress itself. Submit the path to CSV 2 POST, CSV 2 POST does not handle the upload. I have left this independent because there is security to consider for a lot of .csv files and the user should decide where best to store the file.
1. Please ensure wherever your .csv file is stored that WordPress has permission to access the folder and file. Permissions can be changed in your hosting control panel for a directory. Developer software such as PhpED also allows it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= As a WebTechGlobal subscriber can I get higher priority support for this plugin? =
Yes - subscribers are put ahead of my Free Workflow and will not only result in a quicker response for support
but requests for new features are marked with higher priority.

= Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me? =
Yes - you can pay to improve the plugin to suit your needs. However many improvements will be done free.
Please post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable
within my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks
priority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.

= Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds? =
Download .csv files from Commission Junction then upload them or paste a URL directly to a .csv file on any domain to import it that way.
Commission Junction and all other affiliate networks are supported. 

= Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create? =
There are no limits others than what your server will allow you to do in a single request.

= Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO? =

request for free. The plugin also offers text-spinning without limits and there is more planned on that.

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the WordPress core.

== Changelog == 
= 8.2.0 =
* Feature Changes
    * New Directory Sources screen lists directories intended for providing multiple .csv files.
    * New Data History view focuses on data import events, file changes, new file detection.
    * New Data Alerts view displays newly detected files that require manual import (auto import not active). 
    * Separate areas added for management of all projects and management of the current active projects.
    * Plugins main page (plugin dashboard) has gone in reverse, with forms being moved again, we found it never had the usefullness intended
    * Due to variations in .csv files. The project data view only has the default columns. Data displayed will help us monitor the plugins precise activities. That is important if we are to decide if and when the plugin is hyper or not doing enough automation.
    * Menus removed from category descriptions form. User must always enter one or more tokens.
* Technical Notes
    * Submission of directory source form now adds another entry to the sources database table with source type "localdirectory"
    * Form registration (WTG security system) has been changed to keep registered form data longer. It no longer resets if a second tab is opened.  
* Known Issues
    * Still no easy step by step approach like versions had two years ago. This is coming again soon.    
    * Data Table view is not suitable as tables are too wide, column titles cannot be read
    * Some forms are not suitable for being in the narrow sidebar by default, probably use that bar for quick tools and small information.

= 8.1.37 =

    * Beta area removed.
    * Some views merged into the plugins own dashboard to give the dashboard more purpose. When creating a new data source or project return to the dashboard

    * Data Table view is now a proper WP datatable - search ability will be improved later for this view. 
    * Update screen no longer has two columns.
    * Update screen no longer displays the Quick Actions bar.
    * Removed Update Screen - changes to installation will now be automatic, no user action required, quicker and simplier. 
    * Default project settings will no longer be applied for ever new project - a cause of empty custom field rules.
    * Removed any mention of pro or paid left over from premium edition but did add stronger encouragement for donations.
    * Big update to class-forms.php (range of new methods added that make form development far quicker)
    * New mass publish from draft form added - allows selection of current projects posts only, all projects posts or the entire blog (posts not created by CSV 2 POST).
    * Every instance of hidden_form_values() replaced with form_start() - early tests indicate success. This change applies more security against hackers.
    * Sample Data panel now has a list of .csv files for download from WebTechGlobal.
* Technical Notes
    * Class C2P_ImportTableInformation_Table has been moved from class-csv2post.php to table.php (a view file, the only one that uses the class)

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the CSV 2 POST plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if you need any recent changes. There is nothing wrong with skipping versions if changes do not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.
