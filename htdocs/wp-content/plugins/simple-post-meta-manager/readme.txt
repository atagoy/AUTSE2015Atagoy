Post Meta Manager plugin does two things: replace post meta values and rename post meta keys.

== Description ==

This plugin is for advanced WP editors / developers. It should increase the productivity when your post custom field's values are messed. 

Case 1: Let's say you have a city custom field - input text - , where an user can enter his location. Some of the users
will enter correctly the name of the city, some of them not. 

With the help of this plugin you can select the city custom field , the mistyped city name and you have the possibility to 
rename it. 

Case 2: Let's say you have 2 custom fields:

- cpt_city1 for custom post type1
- cpt_city2 for custom post type2

Rename cpt_city1 to city and cpt_city2 to city will merge all the values from cpt_city1, cpt_city2 to city.


PS: Always create database backup before renaming or replacing meta keys / values.
