<h1>Installation</h1>
<ul>
<li>1.	Unzip the template file (simplix.zip) that you have downloaded.</li>
<li>2.	Via FTP, upload the whole folder (Simplix) to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ folder. Do not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp-content/themes/Simplix/index.php (for example).</li>
<li>3.	Check the CHMOD. For the files must be 644 and for the folders 755</li>
<li>4.	Log into your WP admin panel and click on the Design tab. Now click on the Simplix theme to activate it.</li>
<li>5.	<em>Note: When first clicking the theme to activate it, the preview panel will show that the theme contains "errors", but this is only because you haven't set up the Theme Options yet.</em></li>
<li>6.	Complete all of the required inputs on the Simplix Options page (in the WP admin panel) and click "Save Changes". Section 2 below details this process.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Uploading Images for Thumnails</h2>
<p>You could skip these points if you choose the <strong>First-Image on the Thumbnail assignment</strong> which means that images will be generated automatically. To have your thumbnail generated, simply add images in your post and the first-images will be used as thumbnails. If you choose <strong>Custom Post</strong> image Add a custom field in the post. The custom field key <strong>MUST be 'Image'</strong> (letter cases are important). Please reference the screenshot below and follow the subsequent instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.	On your Write > Post tab, complete all of the standard fields when adding a new post.</li>
<li>2.	Then, click on the "Add Media" icon and upload an image of your choice.</li>
<li>3.	Once uploaded, copy the complete "Link URL" field.</li>
<li>4.	Now scroll down to the Custom fields. Fill the custom field value with the path of your image. If you have the image located at http://www.yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/file_name.jpg then the key value of the custom field MUST be http://www.yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/file_name.jpg</li>
<li>5.	Click add custom field and publish post.</li>
</ul>
