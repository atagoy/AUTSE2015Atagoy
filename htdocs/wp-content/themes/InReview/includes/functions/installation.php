<span class="boldtext">How do I add the thumbnails to my posts? </span>
<div class="indent">
  <p>InReview utilizes a script called TimThumb to automatically resize images. Whenever you make a new post you will need to add a custom field. Once you are on the edit/write page screen, click the "Screen Options" link on the top right of the screen and make sure "Custom Fields" is checked. Scroll down below the text editor and click on the &quot;custom fields&quot; link. In the &quot;Name&quot; section, input &quot;Thumbnail&quot; (this is case sensitive). In the &quot;Value&quot; area, input the url to your thumbnail image. Your image will automatically be resized and cropped. The image must be hosted on your domain. (this is to protect against bandwidth left) </p>
  <p><span class="style1">Important Note: You <u>must</u> CHMOD the &quot;cache&quot; folder located in the InReview directory to 777 for this script to work. You can CHMOD (change the permissions) of a file using your favorite FTP program. If you are confused try following <a href="http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/ftp/ftp_chmod.htm"><u>this tutorial</u></a><u>.</u> Of course instead of CHMODing the template folder (as in the tutorial) you would CHMOD the &quot;cache&quot; folder found within your theme's directory. </span></p>

<span class="boldtext">How do I add my title/logo? </span>
<div class="indent">
In this theme the title/logo is an image, which means you will need an image editor to add your own text. You can do this by opening the blank logo image located at Photoshop Files/logo_blank.png, or by opening the logo PSD file located at Photoshop Files/logo.psd. Replace the edited logo with the old logo by placing it in the following directory: theme/InReview/images, and naming the file "logo.png". If you need more room, or would like to edit the logo further, you can always do so by opening the original fully layered PSD file located at Photoshop Files/InReview.psd  </div>
