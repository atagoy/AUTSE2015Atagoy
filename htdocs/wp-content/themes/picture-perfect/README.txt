HOW TO INSTALL
**************************************************

	Unzip and then then copy the slidingdoor directory  to /wp-content/themes/ in your wordpress installation. Then choose the theme from your wordpress Design menu.
	
	Create 7 pages in wordpress - the pictures will automatically link to these 7 pages.
	
	Use the 'page links to' link down the bottom of each page to point these elsewhere if you need to.

SITE HEADING
**************************************************

The theme has the ability to have two colours in the blog heading. To use this optional effect you simply need to place square brackets around any words that you want to be darker. For example on my site I have as the blog name "free[wordpress]theme[!]" so the "wordpress" and "!" is darker. This does not effect the page title where the brackets are replaced by spaces.

DESCRIPTION
**************************************************

I found an effect I really liked at phatfusion.com and aaronbirchphotography, which is called image menu. I created a wordpress theme round it called sliding doors. This is a modification of sliding doors to have the sliders on the left.
